1) Explain about Updating phase in lifecycle component


      => The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

      => A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.


      => React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

           1-getDerivedStateFromProps()
           2-shouldComponentUpdate()
           3-render()
           4-getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
           5-componentDidUpdate()
      => The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.
